									<p>I am a recent Computer Science Engineering graduate. I grew inclination towards Data science in my graduation years. Since then, I have immersed myself in data science communities on Medium and across the web. One of the starting projects that I had picked up was web <a href="https://github.com/yashi-shukla/job-board">web scraping</a>. It gave me basal knowledge of Data Analysis and I have been committed to it ever since. </p>
									<p>I got my Summer Internship as a Data Analyst at Alpha Nodus. While working there, I realized how Data Analytics is like storytelling, and making a beautiful and compelling presentation is one of my favorite skills. I worked on <a href="https://public.tableau.com/profile/yashi.shukla5222#!/">Tableau</a> for visual representations and insightful dashboards. The goal has always been to turn data into information & information into insight. In my final semester, I have worked as an Associate Quality Analyst in an Insurance consulting firm, which gave me knowledge about various development lifecycles. I am proficient in <a href="https://www.hackerrank.com/yashishkl1">SQL</a> having worked on clinical as well as insurance domain data.</p>
									<p>I am curious by nature. Machine learning and natural language processing are both excellent tools to understand the world better. Despite the hype over integrating AI into existing technologies, the implementation of machine learning (especially NLP) is still in its infancy. This field is the wild west, and I aspire to work with the pioneers and innovators that create new and amazing things.</p>
									<p>I developed this website so I could learn more about <a href="https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/verify/62GZLH48PHWJ?utm_source=link&utm_medium=certificate&utm_content=cert_image&utm_campaign=pdf_header_button&utm_product=course">web app development</a> and back-end development. Since these skills are crucial to technological development and I believe, that data scientists who can own every step of the lifecycle will prove to be epoch-making.</p>

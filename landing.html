									<p>The environmental sounds consist of a variety of everyday audio noises and events. Most
										of the work done in the area of sound is in voice and music recognition. And non- human sounds
										are still unexplored. The need to solve the problem of environmental sound classification, arises
										from the potential applications of using environmental sounds as a tool and from the fact that
										until now most of the research has been done on human sounds only and non-human sounds are
										still unexplored. The representations are often transformed further into more compact forms of audio
										features.The performance for a robust task, which is recognising sounds in a noisy environment, it
										was observed that the best performance was given by input features that are in fact images. The
										approach used in this project currently proposes the idea to use convolutional neural networks
										(CNN) with the spectrogram image features.</p>

												<h3>Implementation</h3>
											</header>
											<p>The ESC 50 datset used is a collection if 2000
												environmental audio recording of about 5 sec
												duration. The approach used in this
												project currently proposes
												the idea to use
												convolutional neural
												networks (CNN) with the
												spectrogram image
												features (SIF). The accuracy achieved is
												about 84.6%.</p>

										<h2>Applications</h2>
									</header>
									<p>Understanding or recognizing context of sounds in environmental
										surroundings is very important in terms of making the next move
										based on a sound that occurred. Examples include evacuating a
										building on hearing a fire alarm or attending to a baby on hearing
										the cries. Such activities depend on human hearing which intelligently filters out sounds and quickly recognizes it thereby signaling
										the brain to take the next step. According to the World Health Organization, over 360 million individuals worldwide suffer from
										some form of disabling hearing loss. Deaf individuals can neither
										hear sounds nor distinguish between many sounds. Such situations
										could be life threatening at times and also inconvenient.
										Providing access to sound in some other form of communication are in demand for its practical applications towards assisting
										deaf individuals in their daily activities. This model has been made by keeping such utilities of context recognition in mind.</p>
